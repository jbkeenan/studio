## ThermoAI - Developer Session Summary

**Date:** 2024-08-17 (Note: Actual timestamp in filename will reflect generation time)

**Session Goal:** Refine iCalendar handling, implement booking-specific automation overrides, simulate server-side iCal sync, and discuss transition to a persistent backend.

### Overall Project Rationale (ThermoAI):

ThermoAI aims to be an intelligent thermostat automation application, particularly for users managing multiple properties. The core goals include:
*   Providing AI-powered smart schedule suggestions to optimize energy usage based on property characteristics, occupancy, and weather.
*   Offering an improved and intuitive thermostat interface with features like circular temperature controls, current temperature/humidity display, and quick presets.
*   Implementing a smart notification system for alerts, maintenance reminders, and energy usage summaries.
*   Ensuring an enhanced mobile experience through responsive design and interactive elements.
*   Adhering to a specific style guide (soft blue primary, light blue background, soft green accent, PT Sans font, consistent icon usage).

### Main Features & Discussions (This Session):

1.  **iCalendar Sync Error Refinement:**
    *   Iteratively refined the prompt within the `parseIcalFeed` Genkit flow (`src/ai/flows/parse-ical-flow.ts`) to better instruct the AI. The goal was to ensure that structurally valid but empty iCal feeds (e.g., no VEVENTs with a DTSTART) are recognized as such, without the AI flagging them as an "error" in its output structure.
    *   Updated `parseIcalFeedAction` in `src/app/actions.ts` to more robustly interpret specific "empty calendar" messages returned by the AI flow as non-critical. This allows the UI to correctly display "No bookings found" instead of a generic "Sync Error" in such scenarios.

2.  **Enhanced Booking Display & Interaction:**
    *   Modified the property detail page (`src/app/dashboard/property/[propertyId]/page.tsx`) to display booking events in the table specifically for the month selected in the `ShadCalendar` component.
    *   Implemented an event detail dialog, triggered by clicking a booking in the table. This dialog shows the event summary, formatted check-in/out times, and the *configured property-level automation rules* that would apply.

3.  **Calendar Day Highlighting & Booking-Specific Overrides:**
    *   Updated `src/app/dashboard/property/[propertyId]/page.tsx` and `src/app/globals.css` to visually highlight days with bookings on the main `ShadCalendar` component (using a distinct background color).
    *   Implemented functionality where clicking a booked day on the calendar opens a new dialog.
    *   This "override" dialog displays basic booking information, the property-level default automation effects for that booking, and allows users to input:
        *   Custom AC ON time (HH:MM format) for the check-in day.
        *   Custom AC ADJUST time (HH:MM format) for the check-out day.
        *   Custom checkout preset temperature.
    *   These booking-specific overrides are saved to and loaded from `localStorage`, uniquely identified by the property ID and the booking's UID.
    *   The main event detail dialog (from table click) was updated to also display these custom overrides if they exist and provide an "Edit Overrides" button to open the override dialog.

4.  **Simulated Server-Side Background iCal Sync:**
    *   Discussed the components required for true server-side background syncing (persistent database, scheduler service).
    *   Implemented a simulation of this process:
        *   Modified `src/lib/mock-properties.ts`:
            *   Made the `mockProperties` array mutable (`let`).
            *   Added `icalUrl`, `syncedBookingEvents` (for storing parsed events), and `lastSyncTimestamp` fields to the `Property` interface.
            *   Added an `updatePropertySyncData` function to allow in-memory updates to these fields for a given property.
        *   Created a new API route: `src/app/api/sync-icals/route.ts`. This route (`GET` or `POST`):
            *   Iterates through `mockProperties`.
            *   For properties with an `icalUrl`, it calls the `parseIcalFeed` Genkit flow.
            *   Uses `updatePropertySyncData` to store fetched events and sync time into the in-memory `mockProperties`.
            *   This simulates what a scheduled background job would do.
        *   Updated `src/app/dashboard/property/[propertyId]/page.tsx` to:
            *   Load initial `icalUrl`, `syncedBookingEvents`, and `lastSyncTimestamp` from the (potentially updated) `mockProperties` store.
            *   If no pre-synced events are found but an iCal URL exists, trigger an initial sync for that property.
            *   Display the "Last synced" time for the iCal feed.
            *   When a manual sync is performed or the iCal URL is changed in settings, call `updatePropertySyncData` to update the mock "database."

5.  **Guidance on Firebase Setup for True Backend Implementation:**
    *   Discussed how Firebase services (Firestore for database, Cloud Functions for server-side logic, Cloud Scheduler for cron-like jobs) can be used to build a production-ready background sync.
    *   Provided a conceptual guide on how the user would set up Firestore, initialize Cloud Functions in their project, and configure Cloud Scheduler through the Firebase/Google Cloud console. Clarified that these are setup steps external to the Firebase Studio AI interaction.

### Key Changes Made to Files:

*   **`src/ai/flows/parse-ical-flow.ts`**: Refined AI prompt for better handling of empty (but valid) iCal feeds.
*   **`src/app/actions.ts`**: Improved error message interpretation in `parseIcalFeedAction` to treat specific "empty calendar" messages from AI as non-critical.
*   **`src/app/dashboard/property/[propertyId]/page.tsx`**: Extensive modifications:
    *   Displaying bookings relevant to the selected calendar month.
    *   Event detail dialog showing property automation rules.
    *   Visual highlighting of booked days on the main calendar.
    *   Dialog for setting booking-specific automation overrides (AC on time, AC adjust time, checkout temp).
    *   Saving/loading these overrides to/from `localStorage`.
    *   Integration with the simulated server-side sync: loading initial data from `mockProperties` and updating it.
*   **`src/app/globals.css`**: Added `day-booked` CSS class for styling calendar days.
*   **`src/lib/mock-properties.ts`**:
    *   Made `mockProperties` array mutable.
    *   Added `icalUrl`, `syncedBookingEvents`, and `lastSyncTimestamp` to `Property` interface.
    *   Implemented `updatePropertySyncData` for in-memory updates.
*   **`src/app/api/sync-icals/route.ts` (New File)**: Created to simulate a server-side background job that fetches iCal data for all properties and updates the in-memory `mockProperties`.

### Important Decisions Made (This Session):

*   Adopted an iterative approach to refine AI prompts and action-layer logic for correctly handling empty iCal feeds as valid, non-error states.
*   Chose to use `localStorage` for storing booking-specific automation overrides, acknowledging this is a client-side solution suitable for the current development phase.
*   Implemented a simulated server-side iCal sync using an API route and in-memory updates to `mock-properties.ts` as a practical step towards a full backend solution, allowing frontend development to proceed.
*   Determined that clicking booked days on the calendar is the user interface for accessing and setting booking-specific overrides.

### Unresolved Points or Future Considerations:

*   **Actual Thermostat Automation Logic:** The critical step of the system *acting* on the booking data, automation rules, and overrides to control thermostats is still unimplemented.
*   **Real-time Thermostat State & Control:** Current thermostat components are mock.
*   **Advanced AI Features:** Dynamic energy saving calculations, AI learning from live data, AI-generated notifications.
*   **Persistent Backend Implementation:** Transitioning from `mock-properties.ts` and `localStorage` to a robust database (e.g., Firestore) and scheduler (e.g., Cloud Scheduler via Cloud Functions) for all property data, iCal URLs, settings, overrides, and the iCal sync process.
*   **User Accounts and Authentication.**
*   **UI/UX Polish:** Including animations, energy usage graphs, and strict adherence to active/inactive icon states from the PRD.
*   **Detailed Property Characteristics for AI:** Expanding inputs for AI schedule suggestions.

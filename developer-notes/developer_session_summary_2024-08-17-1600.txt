## ThermoAI - Developer Session Summary

**Date:** 2024-08-17 (Note: Actual timestamp in filename will reflect generation time)

**Session Goal:** Transition the dashboard to support multiple properties, implement iCalendar (iCal) feed integration for booking awareness, and display booking information alongside property-specific automation settings.

### Overall Project Rationale (ThermoAI):

ThermoAI aims to be an intelligent thermostat automation application, particularly for users managing multiple properties. The core goals include:
*   Providing **AI-powered smart schedule suggestions** to optimize energy usage based on property characteristics, occupancy, and weather.
*   Offering an **improved and intuitive thermostat interface** with features like circular temperature controls, current temperature/humidity display, and quick presets.
*   Implementing a **smart notification system** for alerts, maintenance reminders, and energy usage summaries.
*   Ensuring an **enhanced mobile experience** through responsive design and interactive elements.
*   Adhering to a specific **style guide** (soft blue primary, light blue background, soft green accent, PT Sans font, consistent icon usage).

### Main Features Worked On (This Session):

1.  **Multi-Property Dashboard Structure:**
    *   The main dashboard (`/dashboard`) was reconfigured to list properties.
    *   A dynamic property detail page (`/dashboard/property/[propertyId]`) was created to show thermostats, AI scheduling, and calendar functionalities specific to a selected property.
    *   Mock property data (`src/lib/mock-properties.ts`) was introduced to simulate multiple properties with their own thermostat configurations.

2.  **iCalendar (iCal) Feed Integration:**
    *   **Genkit Flow for Parsing:** A new Genkit flow (`src/ai/flows/parse-ical-flow.ts`) was created to fetch and parse iCal feed URLs using an LLM. This flow extracts event details (UID, summary, start/end dates, description, location).
    *   **Server Action:** A new server action (`parseIcalFeedAction` in `src/app/actions.ts`) was added to call the Genkit flow and handle its response.
    *   **UI for iCal Sync:** The property detail page now includes:
        *   An input field for the iCal feed URL (defaulted to a sample OwnerRez feed for testing).
        *   A "Sync" button to trigger iCal parsing.
        *   Display of fetched booking events in a table, filtered by the month selected in the main calendar component.
        *   Error handling and display for iCal sync issues, with iterative improvements to distinguish empty-but-valid calendars from actual errors.

3.  **Automation Settings Stub & Booking Details:**
    *   Input fields for "Hours before check-in to turn on," "Hours after check-out to adjust," and "Checkout preset temperature" were added to the property detail page.
    *   A "Save Automation Settings" button was added.
    *   **localStorage Persistence:** The iCal URL and these automation settings are now saved to and loaded from `localStorage` on a per-property basis.
    *   **Event Detail Dialog:** Clicking a booking event in the table now opens a dialog displaying the event's details (summary, check-in/out times) and the *configured automation rules* for that property.

4.  **Bug Fixes & Refinements:**
    *   Resolved a Next.js `legacyBehavior` error in the `Link` component on the property listing page.
    *   Iteratively troubleshooted iCal parsing (added `User-Agent` header, refined content checks in the flow, and adjusted AI prompt and action layer error handling for empty calendars).

### Key Changes Made to Files (and Why):

*   **`src/lib/mock-properties.ts` (New):** Created to provide a structured way to manage mock data for multiple properties and their thermostat configurations, facilitating the multi-property dashboard.
*   **`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (Modified):** Transformed from the main application view into a property listing page. It now fetches and displays properties from `mock-properties.ts`, with links to their detail pages.
*   **`src/app/dashboard/property/[propertyId]/page.tsx` (New):** Implemented as the detailed view for a single property. This page now hosts the thermostat controls, the main `ShadCalendar`, the new iCal sync section (URL input, sync button, event table, automation rule inputs), and the AI scheduling assistant. It manages state for iCal data, loading, errors, and the event detail dialog. It also handles `localStorage` for iCal/automation settings.
*   **`src/ai/flows/parse-ical-flow.ts` (New):** Developed a Genkit flow to encapsulate the logic for fetching an iCal feed and using an LLM to parse its content into structured event data. The prompt was refined to handle empty calendars gracefully.
*   **`src/ai/dev.ts` (Modified):** Updated to import and register the new `parse-ical-flow.ts`.
*   **`src/app/actions.ts` (Modified):** Added `parseIcalFeedAction` to expose the iCal parsing flow to the frontend. Error handling was refined here to interpret specific "empty calendar" messages from the AI as non-errors.
*   **`src/app/page.tsx` (Modified):** Simplified to a landing/welcome page with a link to the new `/dashboard`. Retained the Developer Notes area.

### Important Decisions Made (This Session):

*   **Multi-Property Architecture:** Shifted from a single dashboard view to a property list leading to individual property detail pages.
*   **iCal Parsing with Genkit LLM:** Decided to use an LLM-based Genkit flow for parsing iCal feeds, aiming for flexibility.
*   **Client-Side Persistence for Settings:** Opted to use `localStorage` for saving iCal URLs and automation rule inputs on a per-property basis for simplicity in this iteration.
*   **Monthly Event Display:** The booking table shows events relevant to the month selected in the `ShadCalendar`.
*   **Iterative Error Handling for iCal:** Adopted a strategy of refining prompts and action-layer logic to correctly handle empty iCal feeds as a valid, non-error state.

### Unresolved Points or Future Considerations:

*   **Actual Thermostat Automation:** The core logic to *use* the iCal events and the configured automation rules (e.g., "turn on X hours before check-in") to control thermostats is not yet implemented.
*   **Highlighting Calendar Dates:** The main `ShadCalendar` component does not yet visually indicate days with bookings.
*   **Storing Past AC Settings:** The event detail dialog currently shows configured automation rules, not the actual historical AC settings for past events (as this data isn't stored).
*   **Robustness of LLM iCal Parsing:** While functional for the sample, complex or non-standard iCal feeds might challenge the LLM. A dedicated iCal parsing library could be a fallback if needed.
*   **Server-Side Storage for Settings:** For a production app, iCal URLs and automation rules should ideally be stored in a backend database, not just `localStorage`.
*   **Real-time Updates:** The iCal feed is currently synced manually or on page load. Automatic background syncing could be added.
